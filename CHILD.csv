"Families living in poverty often resort to child labor as a means of supplementing household income. The need for immediate financial support may prompt parents to send their children to work instead of school.","Inadequate or unavailable educational facilities can lead to children not attending school, pushing them into the workforce at a young age.","In some cultures, there may be social norms that encourage children to work, considering it a part of their upbringing or necessary for family survival.","Weak enforcement or absence of laws prohibiting child labor can lead to its prevalence in certain regions.","Industries seeking cheap labor might exploit vulnerable populations, including children, in countries with lax labor laws and poor enforcement.","Rural families migrating to urban areas in search of better opportunities might find themselves in situations where children need to work to contribute to the family income.","Orphaned, abandoned, or children from broken families may end up in situations where they have to support themselves, leading to child labor.","During times of conflict, natural disasters, or humanitarian crises, children might be forced to work due to economic instability or displacement."
